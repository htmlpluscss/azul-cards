			Welcome to <b>Azul Cards</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			By accessing, creating, or using an Azul Card or any related service (including the website, Telegram interface, or crypto top-up functionality), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the following Terms of Use. <br>
			Please read them carefully before using our services.
		</p>

		<h2>
			General Information
		</h2>

		<p>
			Azul Cards is a <b>financial technology (fintech) platform</b> providing access to virtual payment cards and crypto-fiat payment tools. Azul Cards is <b>not a bank, money transmitter, or licensed financial institution</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			All cards are issued, operated, and maintained by <b>regulated banking or payment partners</b> authorized to provide such services in their respective jurisdictions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Azul Cards operates as a <b>technical and marketing intermediary</b>, providing users with tools to create, manage, and top up virtual cards using cryptocurrency. The card itself, its balance, and its financial obligations are under the control of the issuing partner, not Azul Cards.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Relationship with Card Issuers
		</h2>

		<p>
			Each virtual card offered through Azul Cards is issued by a licensed partner under its own regulatory framework. <br>
			The <b>terms and conditions of your specific card</b> — including spending limits, fees, and refund rules — are provided at the moment of card activation or when linking your card to <b>Apple Pay or Google Pay</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Azul Cards does not hold, store, or manage customer funds. All fiat balances, payments, and transactions are processed by the issuing financial institution. <br>
			Azul Cards provides only the software interface and support for user interaction with those institutions.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Fees and Refunds
		</h2>

		<p>
			A one-time issuance fee may apply to new cards. <br>
			This fee may be refunded after you meet a specific spending threshold.  All such amounts and thresholds are determined by the issuing partner and may vary depending on region or verification level.
		</p>

		<p>
			Azul Cards strives to maintain <b>transparent pricing</b> — there are <b>no hidden or recurring fees</b>. <br>
			Any applicable blockchain network fees or conversion costs are displayed clearly before transaction confirmation.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Crypto Top-Ups and Conversions
		</h2>

		<p>
			Crypto deposits and conversions are handled through third-party infrastructure providers and may involve blockchain transaction fees (“gas fees”). <br>
			The time required for your top-up to appear on your card depends on network congestion and the partner’s processing queue.
		</p>

		<p>
			All conversions from cryptocurrency to fiat are performed by the licensed payment partner or its liquidity provider.  Azul Cards does not convert, hold, or custody your crypto assets.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please ensure that you send funds using the <b>correct blockchain network</b> — using the wrong network may result in permanent loss of funds.  Azul Cards cannot reverse or refund transactions made on unsupported networks.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Service Availability and Liability
		</h2>

		<p>
			Azul Cards aims to provide continuous and reliable service; however, we cannot guarantee uninterrupted operation or access.  Temporary downtime, maintenance, or network disruptions may occur. <br>
			Azul Cards shall not be held liable for any losses, delays, or damages arising from:
		</p>

		<ul>

			<li>
				actions or failures of card-issuing banks or payment networks,
			</li>

			<li>
				interruptions or delays in blockchain confirmations,
			</li>

			<li>
				user mistakes during top-ups or card linking,
			</li>

			<li>
				force majeure events or technical incidents outside our control.
			</li>

		</ul>

		<p>
			Users are responsible for ensuring that the use of Azul Cards complies with the laws and regulations of their own country or region.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Compliance and Legal Use
		</h2>

		<p>
			Azul Cards are intended for lawful personal or business use only. <br>
			You agree not to use the service for illegal activities, including but not limited to: <br>
			money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, gambling (where restricted), or sanctions violations.
		</p>

		<p>
			Azul Cards reserves the right to suspend or restrict service in jurisdictions where cryptocurrency or prepaid card usage is prohibited by local law.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Data Protection and Privacy
		</h2>

		<p>
			Azul Cards collects minimal personal data, only what is necessary for operating your account (such as your email or Telegram handle).  Some partner banks may require limited verification data for compliance and fraud prevention.  Azul Cards never sells or shares user information with unauthorized third parties. <br>
			For details, see our <a href="/privacy-policy" class="link">Privacy Policy</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Apple Pay and Google Pay Integration
		</h2>

		<p>
			When linking your Azul Cards to <b>Apple Pay</b> or <b>Google Pay</b>, you may be subject to the <b>terms of service and privacy policies</b> of those platforms as well as of the card-issuing bank.  Azul Cards does not control or influence the approval, rejection, or performance of Apple Pay / Google Pay integrations. <br>
			Some regions may experience delays or limitations in wallet linking due to local banking rules.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Updates and Modifications
		</h2>

		<p>
			Azul Cards may update or modify these Terms of Use from time to time to reflect regulatory changes, partner updates, or product improvements.  The most recent version is always available on this page and takes effect immediately upon publication.
		</p>

		<p>
			Continued use of the service constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.
		</p>
