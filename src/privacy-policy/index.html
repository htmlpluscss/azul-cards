			Your privacy matters to us.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy explains how <b>Azul Cards</b> (“we”, “our”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our website, Telegram bot, virtual cards, or any related services (“the Service”).
		</p>

		<p>

			If you do not agree, please discontinue use of our services.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Who We Are
		</h2>

		<p>
			Azul Cards is a <b>financial technology platform</b> providing access to virtual cards and crypto-based payment tools issued by licensed financial partners.
		</p>

		<p>
			Azul Cards is <b>not a bank</b> and does not directly store or manage user funds. We act as a technology intermediary, connecting you with regulated payment providers.
		</p>

		<p>
			From day one, <b>user privacy and security have been core principles</b> of our platform. We are committed to collecting and processing the <b>smallest possible amount of personal data</b> necessary to deliver our service effectively.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Information We Collect
		</h2>

		<p>
			We collect only the information strictly required for technical operation, fraud prevention, and customer support. Depending on your usage, this may include:
		</p>

		<ul>

			<li>
				<b>Basic contact information</b> (email or Telegram username) — for account access and support communication.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Transaction-related data</b> — such as top-up records, currency, and timestamps (we do not store full card numbers or CVVs).
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Technical data</b> — browser type, device model, or IP address, used solely for system security and diagnostics.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Optional compliance data</b> — limited information (e.g., name or phone number) may be requested by the issuing partner to meet banking or anti-fraud requirements.
			</li>

		</ul>

		<p>
			We never request or retain excessive personal information such as government ID, residential address, or detailed identity documents unless explicitly required by the licensed issuing partner.
		</p>

		<h2>
			How We Use Your Information
		</h2>

		<p>
			Your data is used exclusively to operate and improve the service:
		</p>

		<ul>

			<li>
				to create and manage your virtual card;
			</li>

			<li>
				to process crypto top-ups and payments;
			</li>

			<li>
				to ensure system security and prevent abuse;
			</li>

			<li>
				to provide technical and customer support;
			</li>

			<li>
				to comply with legal or banking partner requirements.
			</li>

		</ul>

		<p>
			We do not sell, rent, or <b>trade user information</b> under any circumstances. Your personal data is never used for advertising or behavioral tracking.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Sharing of Information
		</h2>

		<p>
			We share limited information only with trusted partners essential for card operation:
		</p>

		<ul>

			<li>
				<b>Issuing banks and payment institutions</b> for card creation and compliance checks.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Blockchain and conversion providers</b> for crypto top-ups and fiat exchange.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Customer support and infrastructure tools</b> for maintaining service availability.
			</li>

		</ul>

		<p>
			All partners are contractually obligated to handle your data securely and confidentially.  Azul Cards does <b>not</b> grant access to your data to external marketers or analytics networks.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Data Security
		</h2>

		<p>
			Protecting your privacy and funds is a cornerstone of our philosophy.
		</p>

		<p>
			All communications between you and Azul Cards servers are encrypted using <b>TLS/SSL</b>, and all financial operations rely on PCI DSS–compliant infrastructure. Access to sensitive components is tightly restricted, and data is stored only in secure environments. <br>
			We continuously monitor our systems to detect unauthorized access or vulnerabilities.
		</p>

		<p>
			Despite our efforts, no online system is entirely immune to risk. By using our Service, you acknowledge that internet-based transactions may involve external factors beyond our control.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Data Retention
		</h2>

		<p>
			We retain user and transaction data only for as long as needed to operate the Service, fulfill legal obligations, or prevent fraud.  After that, it is safely deleted or anonymized. You may request account deletion and data removal at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:support@azulcards.io"><b>support@azulcards.io</b></a>. <br>
			Certain minimal records (e.g., mandatory transaction logs) may be kept as required by law.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Cookies and Analytics
		</h2>

		<p>
			Azul Cards uses only essential cookies for session management and protection against unauthorized activity.
		</p>

		<p>
			We do not use advertising, fingerprinting, or third-party tracking cookies. Aggregated, anonymous usage data may be analyzed internally to improve system stability and performance.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Third-Party Services
		</h2>

		<p>
			Our products integrate with third-party services such as <b>Apple Pay</b>, <b>Google Pay</b>, and blockchain networks. Each has its own privacy practices and policies.
		</p>

		<p>
			We recommend reviewing those policies separately, as Azul Cards does not control how external platforms handle your information.
		</p>

		<h2>
			International Data Transfers
		</h2>

		<p>
			Your information may be processed or stored on servers located outside your country of residence. <br>
			All data transfers follow strict international standards (GDPR or equivalent) and include contractual protections ensuring confidentiality and compliance.
